# 1.0 Introduction
- The discovery of novel drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important stage in drug discovery and development, allowing for the development of successful treatment regimens and the advancement of personalized medicine. Existing understanding of drug-target interactions might be a good starting point for discovering new DTI candidates. By studying similarities in drug or target properties such as chemical structure, side effects, and illness linkages, it is possible to predict that medications and targets with equivalent qualities may have similar mechanisms of action.

- Despite this, the vast drug-target area is a substantial problem. The drug-target interaction matrix has 7,258,230 entries, which represent 2,529 medicines and 2,870 targets. However, known interactions account for just 0.0024 percent of this matrix, with 17,390 interactions accessible from DrugCentral as of June 18, 2021. As a result, Luo et al. created DTINet, a network integration approach for predicting drug-target interactions.

- This study aims to increase the accuracy and reliability of DTI predictions by extending existing approaches with a two-stage dimensional reduction strategy. We will utilize Python code snippets to create the main logic of the DTI prediction, leveraging Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Matrix Factorization, approaches often used in recommendation systems. We want to improve the efficacy of drug-target interaction predictions by using NMF to reduce the dimensionality of the data, thereby contributing to the identification of novel drug candidates and the development of drug discovery processes.
