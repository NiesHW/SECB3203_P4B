# 2.0 Software and Hardware Requirements

* Hardware Requirements 

Laptop  : 
For the purpose of handling data preparation, model training, and evaluation, laptops are required  with enough processing power and memory.The specific requirements will depend on the size of the dataset and the complexity of the models weâ€™re working with.

Storage : 
Storage space needed to store the diabetic data, any intermediate files, and the trained models. Ensure you have enough disk space for your dataset and associated files.

* Software Requirements

Data Analysis and Preprocessing:

Python: Python and bio-python  is a popular language for data analysis and machine learning.

Machine Learning Libraries:

Scikit-Learn: This library provides tools for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. It supports SVM, Random Forest, and K-NN.
LS-SVM: Required  to install specific packages or libraries for implementing LS-SVM where it can be found LS-SVM packages in Python.

Operating System: 
Linux and Windows 

Data Visualization
Orange : For creating data visualizations and plots.
