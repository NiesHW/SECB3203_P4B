# 2.1 Software & Hardware Requirements

## Software Requirements:

1.  Django: Python-based web framework that follows the model–template–views architectural patterns and languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is also suitable for implementing the expert system, machine learning models, and AI components.

2. Visual Studio Code: Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

3. Tableau: to explore and visualize the dataset and the model's results.

4. Phymyadmin: Databases or data storage systems for storing and managing the dataset. 

5. Windows 11: Operating System to develop this system. 

## Hardware Requirements:

1. Laptop: Training machine learning models, running the expert system, and handling data processing

2. AMD Ryzen 5 5600H with Radeon Graphics: Processor with High-end GPUs to accelerate the training of deep learning models.

3. 8.00 GB RAM: Sufficient RAM to handle large datasets and complex machine learning models.

4. 476 GB Storage: Sufficient storage capacity for storing the dataset, model parameters, and other project-related data.
