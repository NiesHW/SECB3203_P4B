## 1.INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease, a formidable adversary of the human mind, stands as a stark example of the inexorable march of time and the fragility of our cognitive faculties. This degenerative brain disorder, often synonymous with the slow but relentless erosion of memory and thinking skills, casts a shadow of uncertainty over millions of lives worldwide. As we delve into the intricate web of this affliction, it becomes clear that Alzheimer's disease is not a solitary foe but a complex adversary, rooted in both genetic predisposition and the influence of lifestyle and environmental factors. (Kumar et al., 2022)
At its core, Alzheimer's is primarily characterised by the profound loss of cognitive functioning, a phenomenon that strikes fear into the hearts of individuals and families alike. This disease does not discriminate, affecting people from all walks of life, regardless of their age, race, or background. The symptoms emerge insidiously, often beginning with subtle forgetfulness and gradually intensifying to more severe cognitive impairment, leading to an unsettling journey through the three well-defined stages: mild, moderate, and severe. (Kumar et al., 2022)
Yet, the intricate tapestry of Alzheimer's doesn't end there. Research and technological advancements have opened new doors in the quest to understand and ultimately combat this formidable adversary. Cutting-edge tools, such as Artificial Neural Network Systems (ANNS), have emerged as valuable aids in the early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease. These sophisticated systems allow for the extraction of critical characteristics from brain images, paving the way for swiffer diagnoses and potentially more effective interventions. (Kumar et al., 2022)
As we embark on this exploration of Alzheimer's disease, it becomes evident that the battle against it is a multi-faceted one, encompassing scientific innovation, compassionate caregiving, and the collective hope for a brighter future. In this narrative, we will delve deeper into the intricate mechanisms of Alzheimer's, its genetic underpinnings, and the role of lifestyle and environment in its development. We will also examine the harrowing journey of those affected by this affliction, from the first whispers of forgetfulness to the profound challenges faced in the advanced stages of the disease. Additionally, we will uncover the significant role played by ANNS in the quest to detect Alzheimer's early, potentially transforming the way we approach this relentless adversary.
