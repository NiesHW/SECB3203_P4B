#PROJECT PROPOSAL


#INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease, a formidable adversary of the human mind, stands as a stark example of the inexorable march of time and the fragility of our cognitive faculties. This degenerative brain disorder, often synonymous with the slow but relentless erosion of memory and thinking skills, casts a shadow of uncertainty over millions of lives worldwide. As we delve into the intricate web of this affliction, it becomes clear that Alzheimer's disease is not a solitary foe but a complex adversary, rooted in both genetic predisposition and the influence of lifestyle and environmental factors. (Kumar et al., 2022)
At its core, Alzheimer's is primarily characterised by the profound loss of cognitive functioning, a phenomenon that strikes fear into the hearts of individuals and families alike. This disease does not discriminate, affecting people from all walks of life, regardless of their age, race, or background. The symptoms emerge insidiously, often beginning with subtle forgetfulness and gradually intensifying to more severe cognitive impairment, leading to an unsettling journey through the three well-defined stages: mild, moderate, and severe. (Kumar et al., 2022)
Yet, the intricate tapestry of Alzheimer's doesn't end there. Research and technological advancements have opened new doors in the quest to understand and ultimately combat this formidable adversary. Cutting-edge tools, such as Artificial Neural Network Systems (ANNS), have emerged as valuable aids in the early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease. These sophisticated systems allow for the extraction of critical characteristics from brain images, paving the way for swiffer diagnoses and potentially more effective interventions. (Kumar et al., 2022)
As we embark on this exploration of Alzheimer's disease, it becomes evident that the battle against it is a multi-faceted one, encompassing scientific innovation, compassionate caregiving, and the collective hope for a brighter future. In this narrative, we will delve deeper into the intricate mechanisms of Alzheimer's, its genetic underpinnings, and the role of lifestyle and environment in its development. We will also examine the harrowing journey of those affected by this affliction, from the first whispers of forgetfulness to the profound challenges faced in the advanced stages of the disease. Additionally, we will uncover the significant role played by ANNS in the quest to detect Alzheimer's early, potentially transforming the way we approach this relentless adversary.

#PROBLEM BACKGROUND

1) SVM models are often used for Alzheimer's because they are robust and don't get stuck in local problems like some other techniques. On the other hand, ANNs, which are like deep learning models, are more flexible and robust for certain tasks like continuous learning, working with sequences, and handling lots of data. So, we might see new kinds of ANNs used for Alzheimer's in the future.
Deep learning and ensemble learning techniques also show great promise in accurately handling complex data. Many people prefer SVM because it's easier to understand how it works, unlike deep neural networks, which are more like a mystery box. It's important for the future to focus on making deep learning models more understandable for clinical purposes. (Tanveer et al., 2020)

2) A doctor may use brain imaging tools to find out if the individual has high levels of beta-amyloid, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s; normal levels would suggest Alzheimer’s is not the cause of dementia.
Imaging technologies have revolutionised our understanding of the structure and function of the living brain. Researchers are studying other brain imaging techniques so they can better diagnose and track the progress of Alzheimer’s. (Ave, 2023)

3) The issue here is that when different scientists or labs (we call them institutions) try to measure these markers, they sometimes end up with different results. This happens because they might use different machines or methods for testing (these are the testing platforms). It's a bit like everyone's trying to solve a puzzle, but some are using slightly different pieces and rules, making it tricky to compare what they find.

Currently, experts who work with memory-related diseases like dementia often use tests that look at the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to diagnose Alzheimer's. At the same time, researchers are on a mission to find new markers, these are like clues that can help diagnose and spot other types of dementia too. They're also making sure that these new markers are used in a consistent and reliable way, just like making sure everyone uses the same puzzle pieces, so we can get better at identifying and understanding these diseases. (Ave, 2023)


#PROBLEM STATMENT

The challenge at hand is to establish consistent and reliable methods for detecting and tracking Alzheimer's disease, particularly by utilising brain imaging tools and biomarkers. Current issues arise from variations in measurement across different research institutions, where diverse machines and testing platforms are employed, akin to solving a complex puzzle with slightly differing pieces and rules, hindering the ability to compare findings effectively. Thus, the problem at hand lies in the need for effective and precise diagnostic tools to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other causes of dementia. Currently, brain imaging tools are utilised to identify elevated levels of beta-amyloid, a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's, as its presence strongly suggests the disease. However, a challenge arises when trying to discern the cause of dementia, as normal levels of beta-amyloid could indicate a different origin for cognitive decline. Despite the revolutionary impact of imaging technologies on our comprehension of the brain's structure and function, there is a pressing need to further refine brain imaging techniques to improve Alzheimer's diagnosis and progression monitoring, ensuring that individuals receive the most accurate and timely care.


#AIM & OBJECTIVE

Aim: 
The aim of this project is to enhance the accuracy and consistency of Alzheimer's diagnosis and progression tracking through the utilisation of brain imaging tools and biomarkers.

Objectives:

1)Investigate the effectiveness of brain imaging tools, particularly in detecting high levels of beta-amyloid, a key indicator of Alzheimer's, to distinguish it as the cause of dementia. 
 -This project seeks to harness the capabilities of brain imaging tools to effectively detect and visualise these elevated beta-amyloid levels in the brain. By doing so, it provides a means to distinguish Alzheimer's disease as the underlying cause of dementia in individuals experiencing cognitive decline, thus helping clinicians make more precise diagnoses and enabling tailored treatment strategies for those affected by this debilitating condition.

2)Explore and evaluate emerging brain imaging techniques that can provide more precise diagnoses and better monitoring of Alzheimer's disease.
-These emerging brain imaging techniques hold the potential to not only enhance the early detection of Alzheimer's but also to better monitor its progression over time. By doing so, they enable healthcare professionals to track the disease's development with greater precision, potentially identifying subtle changes in the brain even before noticeable symptoms appear. This heightened level of detail can lead to more effective treatment strategies and, ultimately, an improved quality of life for individuals affected by Alzheimer's.


*SCOPE & LIMITATIONS

The scope of our project is centred on the comparative analysis and detection of Alzheimer's disease utilising MRI images. This comprehensive endeavour involves the examination of various MRI scans to identify distinct patterns and markers associated with the disease. Through this focused exploration, we aim to contribute to the early diagnosis and understanding of Alzheimer's, ultimately advancing healthcare and patient well-being. 

Our research is specifically limited to the detection of Alzheimer's disease, with the primary focus on identifying its presence rather than classifying the stage or severity of the disease. While the detection of Alzheimer's is a crucial step in early intervention and treatment, staging the disease typically involves additional diagnostic criteria and assessments that fall beyond the scope of our current research objectives. Our goal is to contribute to the early identification of Alzheimer's, facilitating timely care and support for affected individuals.


#CONCLUSION

In conclusion, Alzheimer's disease represents a complex and relentless challenge that affects not only individuals but entire communities worldwide. It serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of our cognitive faculties in the face of time's unyielding march. This degenerative disorder, with its gradual erosion of memory and thinking skills, casts a shadow of uncertainty over millions of lives, leaving families and individuals grappling with its profound impact.

However, our understanding of Alzheimer's is not static; it evolves with the advancement of research and technology. This multifaceted adversary, influenced by both genetic predisposition and environmental factors, has become the focal point of innovation and exploration. The profound loss of cognitive functioning, a hallmark of the disease, is a shared concern that transcends age, race, and background, uniting us in the quest for a solution.
