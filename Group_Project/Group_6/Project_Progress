#Project Progress

On Monday (15/10/23), we had two separate meetings with Mr. Hairuddin & Dr. Haslina to approach them as our clients/mentors. 
After discussing with them both, we got a clearer picture and we now understand the flow and requirements of this project better. 
We have come up with approaches, methods, techniques and datasets that can be used for this project. We are yet to decide on specific ones.
