Project Title: Prediction of Ovarian Cancer Prognosis

Problem Background : A significant healthcare with far-reaching implications for women's health, leading to one of the common cause of deaths among women. This disease is often diagnosed at an advanced stage especially when the prognosis is poor, reducing the the chances of successful treatments and survival. Developing accurate early detection methods can lead to earlier diagnosis and improved survival rates

Problem Statement : Predicting the prognosis of ovarian cancer accurately, typically involves analyzing large scale biological data and leveraging various computational methods. The insufficiency of accurate prognostic information may lead to less optimal treatment decisions and outcomes for ovarian cancer patients. This problem is significant because accurate prognosis prediction can help healthcare providers make informed treatment decisions and potentially improve patient outcomes. 

Aim and Objectives :
1. To gain overall understanding of ovarian cancer disease and come up with a highly accurate prediction model 
2. To implement and develope a prediction model for early prognosis identification of ovarian cancer, allowing for timely and appropiate planning for treatment. 
3. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction model in terms of accuracy and reliability.
   
Scopes : 
Domain of the Data
Time frame of the data : 5 years (ideally)
Type of data considered : Multi-omic data (biological data)
Attributes to be used : Presence of specific immune cells , Previous medical conditions , Blood test to check for miRNAs, presence of exosomes in blood.
Area of study : cancer prognosis

Methodology 
Approach : Random Forest(RF) or  Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Since we have not decided on our dataset, we are not cable to compare these methods, but we have narrowed it down to these two.
Data cleaning: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data preprocessing. PCA can be applied to multi-omic datavto reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the relevant information. In the context of predicting ovarian cancer prognosis, PCA can be a valuable method for data preprocessing, especially when dealing with high-dimensional omics data.
Test Data : Scikit-learn Python for testing predictive models in python.
