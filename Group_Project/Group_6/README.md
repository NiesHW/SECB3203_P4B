Project Title: Prediction of Ovarian Cancer Prognosis

Problem Background : 

Problem Statement : Predicting the prognosis of ovarian cancer accurately, typically involves analyzing large scale biological data and leveraging various computational methods. The insufficiency of accurate prognostic information may lead to less optimal treatment decisions and outcomes for ovarian cancer patients. This problem is significant because accurate prognosis prediction can help healthcare providers make informed treatment decisions and potentially improve patient outcomes. 

Aim and Objectives :

Scopes : 
Domain of the Data
Time frame of the data :
Type of data considered : Multi-omic data
Attributes to be used :
Area of study :

Methodology 
Approach : Random Forest(RF) or  Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Since we have not decided on our dataset, we are not cable to compare these methods, but we have narrowed it down to these two.
Data cleaning: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data preprocessing. PCA can be applied to multi-omic datavto reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the relevant information. In the context of predicting ovarian cancer prognosis, PCA can be a valuable method for data preprocessing, especially when dealing with high-dimensional omics data.
Test Data : Scikit-learn Python for testing predictive models in python.
