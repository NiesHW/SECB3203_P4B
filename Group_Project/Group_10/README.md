# Project Progress
**3 October 2023**
We asked Dr Sharin to be our client in Programming for Bioinformatics project. 
She asked us to approach her by preparing the topic and the explanation of the topic we want to do. 
Later, on Tuesday (16 Oct) we will meet her after Programming for Bioinfomatics class when she is free.

**5 October 2023** 
We went to library to find theses related to Bioinfomatics course. 
Mostly, we found the theses about cancer classification using SVM topic.

**15 October 2023** 
We told Dr Zuraini about our project topic related to Leukemia Cancer. Then, Dr Zuraini asked us to approach Dr Sharin first to reconfirmed our client.
She suggested us related topics about cancer we can use as our project topic.

#### Topic: Performance Evaluation of ANOVA and RFE Algorithms for Classifying Breast Cancer Microarray Dataset Using SVM
Problem: Cancer diagnosis and classification are critical components of precision medicine, and leveraging advanced computational methods can significantly enhance the accuracy of these processes. 

Objective:
- Assess the effectiveness of ANOVA and RFE in selecting relevant features from cancer microarray datasets.
- Implement SVM classifiers using features selected by ANOVA and RFE.
- Compare and evaluate the classification performance of these SVM.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq
    It comprises the data of five different forms of cancer, including kidney, breast, lung, prostate and colon.
