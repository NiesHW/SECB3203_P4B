# Project Progress
On 3rd October, 
we has only ask Dr Sharin for discussing about the bioinformatics programming group project. 
She ask us to approach her by bring the topic and the explaination of the project. 
Later on tuesday (16 Oct) will meet her after the class Programming Bioinfomatics when he is free.

On 5 Oct 
we go to libary to find the topic by the thesis that related to bioinfomatics courses. Mostly that we found by the topic classification cancer using SVM.

On 15 Oct 
we has ask Dr Zuraini for discussing about the project. And approach her about our topic that related for Leukemia Cancer and disscuss the related topic. But Dr Zuraini say that we must approach first to Dr sharin first for our project.
but after we disscuss we actually had a new idea to choose a new topic.
we have made decison our project 

#### Topic: Performance Evaluation of ANOVA and RFE Algorithms for Classifying Cancer Microarray Dataset Using SVM
Problem: Cancer diagnosis and classification are critical components of precision medicine, and leveraging advanced computational methods can significantly enhance the accuracy of these processes. 

Objective:
- Assess the effectiveness of ANOVA and RFE in selecting relevant features from cancer microarray datasets.
- Implement SVM classifiers using features selected by ANOVA and RFE
- Compare and evaluate the classification performance of these SVM

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq
    comprises data on five different forms of cancer, including kidney,breast,lung, prostate and Colon.
