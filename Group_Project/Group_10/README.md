# Project Progress
**3 October 2023**
We asked Dr Sharin to be our client in Programming for Bioinformatics project. 
She asked us to approach her by preparing the topic and the explanation of the topic we want to do. 
Later, on Tuesday (16 Oct) we will meet her after Programming for Bioinfomatics class when she is free.

**5 October 2023** 
We went to library to find theses related to Bioinfomatics course. 
Mostly, we found the theses about cancer classification using SVM topic.

**15 October 2023** 
We told Dr Zuraini about our project topic related to Leukemia Cancer. Then, Dr Zuraini asked us to approach Dr Sharin first to reconfirmed our client.
She suggested us related topics about cancer we can use as our project topic.

#### Topic: Recursive Feature Elimination Methods for Gene Selection On Ovarian Cancer Classification 
#### Problem Statement
The diagnosis of ovarian cancer tends to happen at a late stage, and there are few treatment options offered. Ovarian cancer presents a substantial burden to public health. Gene expression data, which offers helpful insights into the molecular pathways underlying cancer, shows potential for improving the classification of ovarian cancer and providing a more accurate diagnosis of the disease. However, there is a challenge that is caused by the huge amount of genes found in gene expression databases. The challenge is to identify a subset of genes that are most relevant for discriminating between samples of ovarian cancer and samples of non-cancerous tissue, to construct an appropriate classification model based on these selected genes, and to gain insights into the biological processes linked with ovarian cancer.

#### Objective
1. **Identify Relevant Genes:** The primary objective is to identify and select a subset of genes from the gene expression dataset that are strongly associated with ovarian cancer. This entails the systematic use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) methods to rank and select genes with high discriminatory power.
2. **Build an SVM Classification Model:** Develop a robust Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model using the selected genes as features. The model should be capable of accurately predicting whether a patient has ovarian cancer based on their gene expression data.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the SVM classification model through rigorous testing and validation. Use metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess its predictive capability.
4. **Gene Expression Pattern Analysis:** Analyze and interpret the gene expression patterns of the selected genes to gain insights into their potential roles in ovarian cancer. Explore gene-gene interactions and pathways that may be biologically significant.
