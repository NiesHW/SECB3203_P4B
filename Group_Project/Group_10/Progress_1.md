# Software and Hardware Requirements

## Hardware ##
1. **Computer:** A reasonably powerful computer with a multi-core processor and sufficient RAM is essential for handling the data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and analysis tasks efficiently.
2. **Storage:** As gene expression datasets can be large, we need to have ample storage space. Enough storage is needed to store the datasets and the various versions of data during preprocessing.
3. **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):** While not strictly necessary, using a computer with a dedicated GPU can significantly speed up the training of machine learning models like SVM, particularly for large datasets. Many libraries and software tools support GPU acceleration.

## Software ##
1. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** : A code editor that's particularly useful for writing, debugging, and managing code, including Python scripts.
2. **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: A powerful machine learning library that provides SVM implementations and tools for model development and evaluation.
3. **WEKA:** A software for machine learning and data analysis, offering a user-friendly interface and a wide range of algorithms and tools for research in bioinformatics and data science.
