## Project Title

# Potential Key Genes Related to the Progression and Prognosis of Gastric Cancer using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis on AGT (gene that make protein angiotensinogen).

## 1.0 Introduction
Gastric cancer or often referred as stomach cancer, is a life-threatening disease that is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells in the lining of the stomach. This cancer is also one of the most common cancers after lung, breast, colorectal, prostate and cervical cancer. Gastric cancer is a prevalent upper gastrointestinal tumor that presents a significant clinical challenge. The prognosis for people with advanced stomach cancer is still unknown despite advancements in medical technology, notably in the early identification and treatment of different malignancies. It has become a concern that stomach cancer is typically discovered at an advanced stage and is frequently associated with a bad prognosis, making it essential to find new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for this dangerous condition.
For evaluating the severity and course of gastric cancer, the traditional TNM (Tumor, Lymph Nodes, Metastasis) staging approach is frequently used. It provides vital insights for treatment plans and prognosis prediction. However, the discovery of molecular markers has the potential to change the treatment of this complex disease by enhancing and improving the current staging approach.
In order to understand the complex genetic landscape of this disease, the study uses data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database in combination with sample sequencing of gastric cancer tissues. Notably, the discovery of AGT (Angiotensinogen), a gene with strikingly aberrant expression in gastric cancer, provides strong evidence for its contribution to the disease's progression. These results suggest new directions for investigating possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets, suggesting a more individualized and successful approach to the treatment of stomach cancer.
This project demonstrates the potential for advanced bioinformatics to unravel the mysteries of gastric cancer, and it makes a strong case for the importance of AGT as a key component in the pathogenesis of the condition. Through these collective efforts, we may be one step closer to enhancing our ability to diagnose, stage, and treat gastric cancer, ultimately improving the lives and prospects of affected patients.
Bioinformatics tools can be used to analyze the genomic data of gastric cancer patients. This helps identify genetic mutations, copy number variations, and gene expression patterns associated with the disease. Such analyses can reveal potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.



## 1.1 Problem Background
The area of oncology has made considerable strides in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous types of cancer because of developments in medical technology. The prognosis for people with advanced stomach cancer is yet unknown, though. Early signs of stomach cancer are frequently uncommon and ambiguous, which delays diagnosis until late stages and reduces the likelihood of a successful treatment.
In recent years, inquiries into the molecular complexities of cancer have increased, according to the area of oncology research. The quest for genetic and molecular markers that can provide information about the development and prognosis of disease is receiving more and more attention from researchers. The importance of particular genes and their patterns of expression in different stages of cancer is now widely understood. Large-scale genomic databases, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the development of high-throughput sequencing technology have given researchers vital tools for studying the genetic causes of malignancies.
The urgent need for objective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for stomach cancer is what this study intends to address. The prognosis for patients particularly those with advanced stages of stomach cancer remains unpredictable despite the availability of cutting-edge medical treatments. The capacity to correctly anticipate disease development and direct treatment approaches is hampered by the absence of clear, trustworthy biomarkers.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to identify genetic markers that are connected to the staging, progression, and prognosis of gastric cancer. This study intends to identify the key genes implicated in gastric cancer by dynamic trend analysis, differential gene expression analysis, survival analysis, and the investigation of tumor immune cell infiltration. AGT is given special attention since it is a gene with a lot of promise. The objective is to close the information gap that exists today and offer a more thorough understanding of stomach cancer, eventually enhancing clinical judgment and patient outcomes.

## 1.2 Problem Statement
The poor diagnosis and prognosis techniques using current clinical methods do have certain drawbacks. Despite the TNM system's useful insights, its forecast accuracy may still be able to be enhanced. Staging criteria may be more objective if these biomarkers can be found, directing treatment choices and maybe improving patient outcomes. 
In this case study, the crucial task of finding these elusive genetic indicators is undertaken. The aim is to use a comprehensive strategy that involves examination of tumor immune cell infiltration, dynamic trend analysis, differential gene expression analysis, and survival analysis. By combining these approaches, the study seeks to identify the critical genes that influence the development and prognosis of gastric cancer, with a special emphasis on AGT as a gene of interest. Understanding the functions and patterns of these genes may provide new opportunities for risk classification and individualized treatment plans.
Despite advances in medical technology, the unpredictability of patients with advanced stomach cancer's prognosis calls for the identification of more precise diagnostic and prognostic indicators. By carefully examining the genetic bases of stomach cancer staging and progression, this project aims to solve this problem with the hope of enhancing clinical judgment and patient outcomes.
