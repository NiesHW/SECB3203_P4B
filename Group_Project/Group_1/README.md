## Project Title

Potential Key Genes Related to the Progression and Prognosis of Gastric Cancer using Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis on AGT (gene that make protein angiotensinogen).

## Problem

Poor diagnosis and prognosis of patients with gastric cancer using current conventional clinical methods.

## Objective

- To identify new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.
- To identify potential critical genes related to gastric cancerâ€™s staging mechanism and to the prognosis of gastric cancer.
