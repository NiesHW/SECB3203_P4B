PROJECT TITLE	


     "Biometric-Based Personalized Dental Prosthesis Design Using 3D Imaging and Machine Learning"


 
PROBLEM BACKGROUND
 
"Biometric-Based Personalized Dental Prosthesis Design Using 3D Imaging and Machine Learning" lies at the intersection of dental health and bioinformatics. Traditional dentures have been the primary solution for individuals with missing teeth, but they often come with issues related to comfort, functionality, and long-term use. These problems can result in discomfort, reduced chewing efficiency, speech difficulties, and even oral health complications. The goal is to use biometric information to create highly customized prostheses that are comfortable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing for individual patients.




This project develop a bioinformatics project that combines dental and biometric data to design personalized dental prostheses, such as dentures or dental implants. By integrating bioinformatics into denture design, researchers aim to create a more personalised and efficient solution for patients. This approach involves analysing genetic and physiological data, as well as factors such as bite force and oral biomechanics, to tailor dentures to an individual's specific needs. The goal is to improve comfort and functionality significantly, leading to better oral health, overall well-being, and quality of life for denture wearers




 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
This research aims to enhance the quality of life for denture wearers by harnessing genetic, physiological, and biomechanical data to create customized denture solutions that significantly improve comfort, functionality, and overall oral health. The primary challenge is to develop an integrated bioinformatic platform that can accurately analyze and interpret individual patient data, subsequently translating these insights into superior denture designs for enhanced patient comfort and well-being.
 
 
 
GOAL
	
Explore computational methods for designing and optimizing dentures to improve their fit, comfort, and functional performance.
 


OBJECTIVES	


To develop a user-friendly bioinformatic platform for processing and analyzing genetic, physiological, and biomechanical data to inform personalized denture design.


To create personalized denture solutions that account for individual variations, thereby significantly improving comfort, fit, and functionality.


To reduce discomfort, speech difficulties, and chewing inefficiency through bioinformatically optimized denture design.


To evaluate the long-term oral health benefits of bioinformatic dentures in preventing potential complications associated with traditional dentures.


To measure and enhance patient satisfaction and overall quality of life by providing superior, tailored denture solutions.
















  SCOPES	


Data Collection
Patient Health Records help researchers understand the overall health of the participants, identify any conditions that might impact oral health, and tailor denture design to individual health needs.


Dental Impressions and Scans provide the foundation for creating customized dentures. They capture the precise shape and alignment of the patient's mouth, enabling accurate denture design and fit.


3D Imaging and Modeling help in the design and optimization of dentures by allowing researchers to visualise and manipulate digital models, experiment with different denture shapes and configurations, and test the fit and function virtually.


Functional Data helps assess the practicality and performance of the dentures. It provides insights into areas where improvements are needed for enhanced functionality.


Patient Preferences and Feedback are essential for understanding subjective aspects of comfort and aesthetics. This data helps in tailoring denture design to meet individual patient needs and preferences.


Materials Data is critical for ensuring that the chosen materials are safe, durable, and suitable for the patient's oral environment. It helps in optimising denture design by selecting the most appropriate materials for each patient.




1 Data Collection:
Collect 3D imaging data of the oral cavity, including impressions, scans, and CBCT data.
Gather biometric data such as tooth measurements, gum tissue characteristics, and occlusion data.
2. Data Integration:


Integrate the collected biometric data with the 3D imaging data to create a comprehensive patient profile.
3. Machine Learning Model:


Develop a machine learning model (e.g., deep learning neural networks) that can analyze the integrated biometric and 3D imaging data.
Train the model to predict the optimal design and specifications for dental prostheses based on individual patient characteristics.
4. Personalized Prosthesis Design:


Use the trained model to generate personalized dental prosthesis designs, including dentures, dental implants, or crowns.
Consider factors like fit, material selection, occlusion, and aesthetics.
