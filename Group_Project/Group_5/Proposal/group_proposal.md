##  GROUP PROJECT PROPOSAL AND GROUP FORMATION 
 

##  PROJECT TITLE	

     "Biometric-Based Personalized Dental Prosthesis Design Using 3D Imaging and Machine Learning"
 
##  PROBLEM BACKGROUND
 
"Biometric-Based Personalized Dental Prosthesis Design Using 3D Imaging and Machine Learning" lies at the intersection of dental health and bioinformatics. Traditional dentures have been the primary solution for individuals with missing teeth, but they often come with issues related to comfort, functionality, and long-term use. These problems can result in discomfort, reduced chewing efficiency, speech difficulties, and even oral health complications. The goal is to use biometric information to create highly customized prostheses that are comfortable, functional, and aesthetically pleasing for individual patients.
This project develop a bioinformatics project that combines dental and biometric data to design personalized dental prostheses, such as dentures or dental implants. By integrating bioinformatics into denture design, researchers aim to create a more personalised and efficient solution for patients. This approach involves analysing genetic and physiological data, as well as factors such as bite force and oral biomechanics, to tailor dentures to an individual's specific needs. The goal is to improve comfort and functionality significantly, leading to better oral health, overall well-being, and quality of life for denture wearers

 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
 
This research aims to enhance the quality of life for denture wearers by harnessing genetic, physiological, and biomechanical data to create customized denture solutions that significantly improve comfort, functionality, and overall oral health. The primary challenge is to develop an integrated bioinformatic platform that can accurately analyze and interpret individual patient data, subsequently translating these insights into superior denture designs for enhanced patient comfort and well-being. 
 
## GOAL
	
Explore computational methods for designing and optimizing dentures to improve their fit, comfort, and functional performance.
 
## OBJECTIVES	


1. To develop a user-friendly bioinformatic platform for processing and analyzing genetic, physiological, and biomechanical data to inform personalized denture design.


2. To create personalized denture solutions that account for individual variations, thereby significantly improving comfort, fit, and functionality.


3. To reduce discomfort, speech difficulties, and chewing inefficiency through bioinformatically optimized denture design.


4. To evaluate the long-term oral health benefits of bioinformatic dentures in preventing potential complications associated with traditional dentures.


5. To measure and enhance patient satisfaction and overall quality of life by providing superior, tailored denture solutions.


## Scope 

## 1.Biometric Data: 
This includes the patient's oral cavity measurements, tooth morphology, bone structure, and other anatomical details. Technologies like intraoral scanners and 3D imaging can provide highly accurate biometric data.


## 2.Genetic Data: 
Genetic information can influence oral health, tooth structure, and susceptibility to certain dental issues. Genetic data can be used to tailor dentures to an individual's specific genetic predispositions.


## 3.Data Collection:
Collect 3D imaging data of the oral cavity, including impressions, scans, and CBCT data.Gather biometric data such as tooth measurements, gum tissue characteristics, and occlusion data.


## 4. Data Integration:
Integrate the collected biometric data with the 3D imaging data to create a comprehensive patient profile.


## 5.Machine Learning Model:
 Develop a machine learning model (e.g., deep learning neural networks) that can  analyse the integrated biometric and 3D imaging data.Train the model to predict the  optimal design and specifications for dental prostheses based on individual patient  characteristics.


## 6. Personalized Prosthesis Design:
Use the trained model to generate personalised dental prosthesis designs, including dentures, dental implants, or crowns. Consider factors like fit, material selection, occlusion, and aesthetics.
