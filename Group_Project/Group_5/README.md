 # Project title 
 
 
Empowering Early Diagnosis: Oral Cancer Detection Web App for Dental Health Using Custom XceptionNet Model

 # Problem 


The current oral cancer diagnosis methods, notably histopathological examination, suffer from delays, subjectivity, and high resource usage. This leads to late detection, impacting treatment effectiveness and straining healthcare systems. To address this, our project aims to develop an automated oral cancer detection system using deep learning and a custom XceptionNet model. By expediting precise cancer identification in histopathological images, we aim to create a user-friendly web application for rapid and accurate early detection. This initiative bridges traditional methods with advanced technology, enhancing patient care and survival rates in oral cancer cases.
