#Project Progress

On last Thursday (12 Oct), we had the first meeting with our client, Dr Sharin for discussing about the bioinformatics programming group project. She gave us a lot of good advices which we will take note to enhance our progress. We took the selfie together and uploaded the photos to GitHub as the evidence for our first meeting.
