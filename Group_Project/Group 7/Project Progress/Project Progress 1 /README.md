##Project Progress

On 12/10/2023, we had a meeting with Dr. Shahrin to discuss our Lung Cancer Prediction project. Dr. Shahrin provided us with valuable guidance, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of lung cancer and our chosen dataset. We are now focused on further research and look forward to our next meeting with her.
