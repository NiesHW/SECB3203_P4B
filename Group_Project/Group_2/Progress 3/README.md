<b>Descriptive statistic<b>

Descriptive statistics typically involve calculating various measures to describe the data's central tendency, 
variability, and distribution. By transposing the DataFrame using transpose(), 
you'll be able to see all columns with their respective statistics.

# Display basic statistics of the dataset
summary_statistics = df.describe().transpose()
print(summary_statistics)
