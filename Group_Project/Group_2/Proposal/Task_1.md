1.0 Introduction
<p>
			This research paper focuses on the domain of heart attack disease, a life-threatening medical emergency necessitating immediate treatment. Heart attacks, or myocardial infarctions, occur when blood flow carrying oxygen to a portion of the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, which results in oxygen deprivation. Without prompt restoration of blood flow, the heart muscle starts to deteriorate. Most heart attacks result from coronary artery disease, and various factors, including age, lifestyle choices, and underlying medical conditions, heighten the risk. Symptoms of a heart attack encompass chest and upper body pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, profuse sweating, and nausea (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute,2022).

The current medical diagnosis of heart attack depends on whether someone had an ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or another type of acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI or unstable angina).If someone shows heart attack symptoms confirmed by an electrocardiogram (ECG) to be a STEMI, the treatment is based on symptom onset time and treatment accessibility. Symptoms within 12 hours usually lead to coronary angiography and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary PCI). If immediate PCI isn't feasible within 12 hours, patients receive medication to dissolve blood clots. Symptoms beyond 12 hours may involve different procedures, determined after an angiogram, which can include medication, PCI, or bypass surgery (NHS, 2023).

Recent research explores heart attack prediction using machine learning. The research explores six different modeling techniques: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Based on the experimental results, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) exhibited the highest precision, and accuracy among the six modeling techniques (Rizwan et al., 2022). In a study by Manjula et al. (2022) the Random Forest algorithm was found to be a powerful tool for both regression and classification procedures when compared to Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. This research paper will focus on the accuracy of Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes methods of machine learning for predicting heart attacks.

1.1 Problem Background
According to the National Institutes of Health(2021), in 2019,  9.6 million men and 8.9 million women globally succumbed to cardiovascular disease, primarily affecting those aged 30 to 70. Myocardial infarction, a consequence of heart disease, is often caused by arterial plaques, leading to restricted blood flow and muscle tissue damage. Refers to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (n.d), in the United States, someone experiences a heart attack every 40 seconds, emphasizing the need for early and accurate detection. A large amount of data generated by the medical industry has not been used effectively previously. Thanfully, the integration of artificial intelligence into medical diagnosis provides a promising solution.These approaches consistently demonstrate a high level of accuracy, affirming their effectiveness (Zhang. Wan & Han. J, 2017). The novel methods introduced here not only cut costs but also enhance the accuracy of heart disease prediction in a straightforward and efficient manner (Mohan et al., 2019). Our approach involves a comparison of two algorithms, logistic regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to estimate the likelihood of a heart attack. This approach is tailored to support healthcare professionals in delivering timely and precise assessments of heart health.</p>

1.2 Problem Statement

The central concern lies in the provision of early and accurate heart attack identification, which is a critical matter with major implications for healthcare. The application of diverse machine learning approaches is expected to contribute to the enhancement of the disease detection accuracy and timeliness, thus resulting in significant improvements in healthcare outcomes and the advancement of disease diagnosis and management.

1.4 Scopes
The scope are :
1. Dataset Description:
The dataset, acquired from Kaggle, consists of records from 303 subjects (instances) and includes 14 columns. This dataset serves as a robust foundation for our analysis and model development.
Dataset Source: Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset (kaggle.com)
2. Software Utilized:
The machine learning program is created using two software platforms: R language and VS Code (Python). These software tools enable us to develop and implement the machine learning framework effectively.
In addition to the core software, all necessary libraries and add-ons have been installed to support the research process.
3. Limitation:
A notable limitation in this research is the potential for processing time delays due to the use of less powerful computers. These delays may have implications for the efficiency of data analysis and the overall research timeline.
