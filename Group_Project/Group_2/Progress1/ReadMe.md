Software and hardware requirements
<p
For this project focusing on analyzing heart attack detection through various classification algorithms, several software and hardware are needed to handle data analysis, machine learning model development, and experimentation. Software requirements for this research project are Python, R, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Git, Microsoft Word and Excel versions 2309, Matplotlib and Seaborn for Python. Python is used for data analysis and preprocessing due to its rich ecosystem of data science libraries. For machine learning and model development R language is used because it has libraries such as “caret” for clarification tasks. Next, VS Code is used for supporting multiple programming languages. Besides, Git is required to track changes and collaborate with team members efficiently. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used for data visualization in Python. Other than that, Microsoft Word and Excel versions 2309 are required for data preparation and analyzing.     

Besides, the hardware required for this research includes a computer with an Intel Core i3 processor, the Windows 11 operating system, 8GB of RAM, and a 222 GB SSD. A modern multi-core CPU is essential in this project for running machine learning algorithms efficiently.  Next, having a substantial amount of RAM is crucial when working with large datasets. High-capacity and fast storage, such as an SSD, is essential for storing datasets, code, and model checkpoints.

<p>  In this project we aimed at heart attack detection, we initiate the process by sourcing a dataset from Kaggle, which comprises 303 instances and 13 attributes, forming the bedrock of our investigation. Subsequently, data preprocessing takes center stage, where data cleaning is employed to address issues such as missing values, duplicate records, and outliers. This step is vital for enhancing data quality and reliability. To ensure that the data is amenable to modeling, we undergo data normalization techniques, such as Z-score normalization, which standardizes the scale across all features.In the data analysis phase, we aim to identify the most important attributes for heart attack detection. To do this, we use the Pearson correlation coefficient. We focus on two key criteria: a p-value below 0.0001 (indicating a strong statistical relationship) and a coefficient close to 1 (indicating a strong positive relationship). Attributes meeting these criteria are selected. Feature selection reduces dataset complexity, boosts model efficiency, and prevents overfitting, ensuring our models focus on the most influential attributes for accurate heart attack prediction. After the feature selection process, we proceed to train our machine learning models, specifically Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. We rigorously assess the performance of each machine learning model using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques. The key metrics we focus on include accuracy, recall, and the F1-score.on, for heart attack detection. In the end, we compare Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to figure out which one does a better job at heart attack detection. This comparison is like a final test to see which algorithm performs more accurately. We do this very carefully to make sure our research provides valuable insights for heart attack detection.
