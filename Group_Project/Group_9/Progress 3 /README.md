# Project Progress: Phase 3

## 4.0 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

In this phase of our project, we are actively engaged in conducting an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to explore potential differences among groups for our carefully selected variables. ANOVA, a robust statistical technique, allows us to discern whether there are significant variations in means across multiple groups. This analysis is instrumental in uncovering insights that contribute to the refinement of our Alzheimer's disease prediction model.

## 4.1 Selected Variables

Our selection of variables is a critical aspect of this phase, driven by the need for relevance to our Alzheimer's disease prediction study. The chosen variables include:

- **Group (Demented/Non-Demented):**
  The "Group" variable categorizes individuals into those classified as "Demented" and "Non-Demented." This serves as our primary outcome variable, distinguishing between individuals with and without cognitive impairment. Understanding the differences in various features between these two groups is fundamental for predictive modeling.

- **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE):**
  The MMSE is a widely used cognitive screening tool. By incorporating MMSE scores, we gain insights into the participants' cognitive abilities. Lower MMSE scores may indicate cognitive decline, and studying its relationship with other variables can enhance our understanding of early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

## 4.2 Rationale for ANOVA

ANOVA is particularly effective for assessing differences in means among multiple groups. In our case, it helps us understand how variables like age and MMSE scores vary between Demented and Non-Demented groups. By applying ANOVA to these variables, we aim to identify if there are statistically significant differences in means across the defined groups. Significant differences can point to variables that might play a crucial role in distinguishing cognitive health states.

The insights gained from ANOVA will inform the refinement of our Alzheimer's disease prediction model. Variables showing significant differences may be prioritized or further investigated for their predictive power. Understanding how these variables vary across different groups is instrumental for tailoring interventions. It provides a foundation for developing targeted strategies based on identified risk factors.
