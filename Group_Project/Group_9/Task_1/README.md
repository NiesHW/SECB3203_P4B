# Random Forest vs. SVM: A Comparative Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction within a Specific Brain Region

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data for a comparative analysis of two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease within a specific brain region, namely the hippocampus. The primary objective of this analysis is to evaluate and compare the performance of these two algorithms and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses in the context of Alzheimer's disease prediction.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare the performance of Random Forest and SVM for predicting Alzheimer's disease within the hippocampus region.

2. **Feature Selection**: Extract and choose relevant features from the hippocampus region for input into the machine learning models.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate both Random Forest and SVM models to determine which one is better at predicting Alzheimer's disease within this specific brain region.

4. **Insights**: Provide insights into the advantages and limitations of these machine learning models in the context of Alzheimer's disease prediction within the hippocampus.

5. **Contributions**: Contribute to the improvement of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and patient care through the development of effective prediction models.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is based on microarray analyses of laser-captured hippocampus samples. It reveals distinct gray and white matter signatures associated with incipient Alzheimer's disease. The dataset can be accessed via the following link:
