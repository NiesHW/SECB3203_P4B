Project Title : Comparing the Efficacy of Univariate Statistical Tests in Predicting Alzheimer's Disease from DNA Methylation Differences
- Objectives:
1. To assess the performance of t-tests and ANOVA in detecting differential DNA methylation at individual CpG sites between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls.
2. To determine which statistical test (t-tests or ANOVA) is more effective in identifying CpG sites with predictive power for Alzheimer's disease.
3. To evaluate the reproducibility and robustness of the selected CpG sites as predictive biomarkers.
